		the task information type was separated into 
		<term>general task</term> and 
		<term>strict task</term>. Technically speaking, the 
		<term>general task</term> is now the base task information type, because
		strict type is implemented as a

	 <p>For documenting most procedures, the 
		<term>strict task</term> is the more appropriate choice. Conceptually, it
		is best to think of the 
		<term>task</term> information type as meaning 
		<term>strict task</term>. The 
		<term>strict task</term> information type is the equivalent of the

		<term>task</term>, while the general task has much more relaxed content
		rules.

		content model is more appropriately served by general task, then stick to
		general task across the document repository. Avoid mixing

			 <ph

			 and 1.1 Strict Task Model. It also adds capabilities to the &lt;steps&gt;
			 content unit for both task models. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>Use the DITA General Task Model when your information model calls
			 for a task structure that is not well supported by the DITA Strict Task Model
			 or when you need to constrain the elements in a task in a way that is unique to
			 your organizationâ€™s needs. Use the DITA General Task Model to convert existing
			 tasks to DITA that do not yet conform to your task information model.

			 also includes the new Machinery Task Model, designed to conform to the
			 requirements of the machine industry, especially in the construction of pre-
			 and post-requirements. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>The new DITA General Task Model allows the following: 
		  </p> 
		  <ul id="ul_A4CCBFFA9ECA4AA2BD7CCA3BB5A890ED"> 
			 <li id="li_21C58EA701F140A9BB83E1D67071F85C">Add a &lt;section&gt;
				with an optional &lt;title&gt; before the steps in the task. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_DC5E8F7EA1B5475C94B337DB35D8814C">Vary the order of
				&lt;prereq&gt;, &lt;context&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; before the steps in the
				task. It's common for some organizations to present &lt;context&gt; information
				before &lt;prereq&gt;, and, in the past, the DITA-OT stylesheets had to be
				customized to switch them around, which is beyond the capability of most users
				who are not well-versed in advanced XSLT coding techniques. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_BA926A6D1ED34D5A8CE59B837C2615CB">Select the new
				&lt;steps-informal&gt; content unit, which allows you to construct steps using
				ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, and other less semantically specified
				elements than &lt;step&gt; and &lt;cmd&gt;. 
			 </li> 
			 <li id="li_273F9D6E4D5A46F3A14D2785C58902E2">Include more than one
				example or pre-requisite in a task after the completion of the steps. 
			 </li> 
		  </ul> 
		  <p>Note that the DITA General Task Model, the DITA Strict Task Model,
			 and the Machinery Task Model are not mutually compatible. Both DITA Strict Task
			 Model and the Machinery Task Model have been redesigned as constraints of the
			 General Task Model. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>You are not able to use a conref between a constrained and a more
			 general task model. A constrained task cannot conref from an unconstrained
			 task. Conref requires that the conref target be at least as constrained (and
			 compatibly constrained) as the conref source (that is, the document making the
			 conref link). Otherwise, you cannot be assured that the conreffed data is valid
			 in the using context. 
		  </p> 
		  <p>We advise organizations to use only one task model unless the
			 content in two areas of publications is completely mutually exclusive and will
			 never be shared. Note, however, that a fundamental DITA principle is the
			 ability to exchange content throughout an organization. It is, therefore, best
			 to avoid using more than one task model.
